# alx-low_level_programming
# More malloc, free
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about how to use `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc` and `exit` functions in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:


File 0-malloc_checked.c is a function that allocates memory using malloc.

File 1-string_nconcat.c is a function that concatenates two strings.

File 2-calloc.c is a function that allocates memory for an array, using malloc.

File 3-array_range.c is a function that creates an array of integers.

File 100-realloc.c is a function that reallocates a memory block using malloc and free.

File 101-mul.c is a program that multiplies two positive numbers.

File holberton.h is the header file for all the function prototypes.
